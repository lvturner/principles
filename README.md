# Intro
*Principles are fundamental truths that serve as the foundations for behavior that gets you what you want out of life. They can be applied again and again in similar situations to help you achieve your goals.*

What is presented on this site, however, is more like a collection of ideas that have been floating around my head for years in desperate need of structure and formalisation.

They're not necessarily the best way to live your life, but they're good starting points. I'm publishing them in the hopes that other's may draw from them and find them useful.

Most of these are experience led, however, be aware, there is plenty of duplication, mistakes, and contradictions within these.

As they said in Pirate's of the Carribean "The code is more what you'd call guidelines, than actual rules."

# Tech
Not much to be said, a simple Go application, as well as a sprinkling of Docker and some config for running with [Traefik](https://traefik.io/traefik/) 
Plenty of AI was used to help create this, and it kind of shows :)
